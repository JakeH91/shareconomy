# With Docker

This examples shows how to use Docker with Next.js based on the [deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment#docker-image). Additionally, it contains instructions for deploying to Google Cloud Run. However, you can use any container-based deployment host.

## Using Docker

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine.
1. Build your container: `docker build -t shareconomy .`.
1. Run your container: `docker run -p 8080:8080 shareconomy`.

You can view your images created with `docker images`.

### In existing projects

To add support for Docker to an existing project, just copy the `Dockerfile` into the root of the project and add the following to the `next.config.js` file:

```js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ... rest of the configuration.
  output: "standalone",
};
```

This will build the project as a standalone app inside the Docker image.

## Deploying to Google Cloud Run

1. Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) so you can use `gcloud` on the command line.
1. Run `gcloud auth login` to log in to your account.
1. [Create a new project](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy) in Google Cloud Run (e.g. `shareconomy`). Ensure billing is turned on.
1. Build your container image using Cloud Build: `gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/helloworld --project PROJECT-ID`. This will also enable Cloud Build for your project.
1. Deploy to Cloud Run: `gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/helloworld --project PROJECT-ID --platform managed`. Choose a region of your choice.

   - You will be prompted for the service name: press Enter to accept the default name, `helloworld`.
   - You will be prompted for [region](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy#follow-cloud-run): select the region of your choice, for example `us-central1`.
   - You will be prompted to **allow unauthenticated invocations**: respond `y`.

Or click the button below, authorize the script, and select the project and region when prompted:

## Running Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:8080/api/hello](http://localhost:8080/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

# Supabase

## Generating Types

Whenever updates are made to any tables in supabase, it is important to regenerate the supabase types (found in `types/supabase.ts`). With a Personal Access Token, you must login to supabase in your terminal with:

```bash
npx supabase login
```

Once successfully logged in, you can run the following command from the root directory (replacing "$PROJECT_ID"):

```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id "$PROJECT_ID" --schema public > types/supabase.ts
```
